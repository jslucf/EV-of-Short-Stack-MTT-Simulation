This is my attempt to quantify the value of a 2.5 BB stack, 6 spots out of the money of a $570 tournament at the Hard Rock in Hollywood, FL in November 2016. I was offered $100 for 25% equity in my tournament and I accepted. 

My goal here is to try to estimate the EV of that deal by trying to simulate the tournament 10,000 times. Since it's impossible to know how often I'd actually be able to finish in certain spots in the tournament versus others, this was largely just a fun exercise. However, I do think it gave me a peace of mind that the deal I accepted was likely not that far off EV as I feared at the time I accepted.
